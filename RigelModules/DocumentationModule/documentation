The module "documentation" takes as argument the name of a module and returns module's manual.
A manual is represented by a string containing all the information needed to use it properly.

This module is best used with an output module, since returning something won't actually show something.

Example

show documentation documentation
show documentation run
find_str test in all documentation then show
